In the first image one can see the relation between the beer consumption of students throughout the years. 
Between the years 2016 and 2018, there is a exponential growth in beer consumption. 
Furthermore in the second plot, the amount of students that have enrolled is shown throughout the years,
there has been an linear increase in the number of students. Therefore, the amount of enrolled students does not directly relate to beer consumption, especially in the period [2016,2018].
